  pageContent: 'Page 5: Radical Resolutions

    While their cause was noble, their
    methods became increasingly radical as peaceful protests escalated to acts of
    magical terrorism against mining sites and ore transportation. The Purists, with
    rogue mages, hatched a bold plan. The ''Ultimate Ritual'' was devised to tap
    directly into Gaian''s core magic, promising unlimited power and a return to
    ancient purity.'
