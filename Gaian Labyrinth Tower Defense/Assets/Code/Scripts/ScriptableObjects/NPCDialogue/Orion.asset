  - Welcome, traveler. I'm Orion, a guide once lost in the shadows of the Purists,
    now seeking light alongside those who strive for peace.
  - As we tread this path together, you'll find my combat skills and knowledge of
    our former allies invaluable. But remember, the truth of our past might be closer
    than we think.
  - In time, you'll confront memories long forgotten, revealing a connection to the
    Purists that binds us more deeply than you could imagine.
  - Farewell, for now. Let the journey ahead fortify your resolve and may the truths
    uncovered guide you towards genuine redemption. Stay strong until our paths cross
    again.
