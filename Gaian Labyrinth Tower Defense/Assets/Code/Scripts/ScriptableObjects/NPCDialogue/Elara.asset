  dialogueLines:
  - 'Welcome, Traveler! '
  - Embrace the silence, for through it, the forest whispers its ancient secrets
    and entrusts you with its sacred magic.
  - Haunted by my past with Myrana, I find redemption in guarding the purity of this
    forest, teaching others to protect what we once took for granted.
  - Farewell, traveler. Let the forest's whisper guide your steps and its peace fill
    your heart until we meet again.
